# T4Template
This small project uses Microsoft's T4 Text Template to create a basic Repo, Entity, and DAL. 
These classes are constructed from the T4 Text that generates the code.

The code generation uses an XML file to read the table, columns and data types. As well, a
MS SQL database is used for testing if code generated DAL and interact with the database.
